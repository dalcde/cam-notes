{\small
\noindent\textbf{Groups}\\
Basic concepts of group theory recalled from Part IA Groups. Normal subgroups, quotient groups and isomorphism theorems. Permutation groups. Groups acting on sets, permutation representations. Conjugacy classes, centralizers and normalizers. The centre of a group. Elementary properties of finite $p$-groups. Examples of finite linear groups and groups arising from geometry. Simplicity of $A_n$.

\noindent Factorization in rings; units, primes and irreducibles. Unique factorization in principal ideal domains, and in polynomial rings. Gauss' Lemma and Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion.

\vspace{5pt}
\noindent Rings $\Z[\alpha]$ of algebraic integers as subsets of $\C$ and quotients of $\Z[x]$. Examples of Euclidean domains and uniqueness and non-uniqueness of factorization. Factorization in the ring of Gaussian integers; representation of integers as sums of two squares.
