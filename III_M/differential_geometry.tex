This course is intended as an introduction to modern differential geometry. It can be taken with a view to further studies in Geometry and Topology and should also be suitable as a supplementary course if your main interests are for instance in Analysis or Mathematical Physics. A tentative syllabus is as follows.

\begin{itemize}[label={$\bullet$}]
 \item \emph{Local Analysis and Differential Manifolds.} Definition and examples of manifolds, smooth maps. Tangent vectors and vector fields, tangent bundle. Geometric consequences of the implicit function theorem, submanifolds. Lie Groups.
 \item \emph{Vector Bundles.} Structure group. The example of Hopf bundle. Bundle morphisms and automorphisms. Exterior algebra of differential forms. Tensors. Symplectic forms. Orientability of manifolds. Partitions of unity and integration on manifolds, Stokes Theorem; de Rham cohomology. Lie derivative of tensors. Connections on vector bundles and covariant derivatives: covariant exterior derivative, curvature. Bianchi identity.

 \item \emph{Riemannian Geometry.} Connections on the tangent bundle, torsion. Bianchi's identities for torsion free connections. Riemannian metrics, Levi-Civita connection, Christoffel symbols, geodesics. Riemannian curvature tensor and its symmetries, second Bianchi identity, sectional curvatures.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
An essential pre-requisite is a working knowledge of linear algebra (including bilinear forms) and multivariate calculus (e.g. differentiation and Taylor's theorem in several variables). Exposure to some of the ideas of classical differential geometry might also be useful.
