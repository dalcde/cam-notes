Algebraic Topology assigns algebraic invariants to topological spaces; it permeates modern pure mathematics. This course will focus on (co)homology, with an emphasis on applications to the topology of manifolds. We will cover singular homology and cohomology, vector bundles and the Thom Isomorphism theorem, and the cohomology of manifolds up to Poincar\'e duality. Time permitting, there will also be some discussion of characteristic classes and cobordism, and conceivably some homotopy theory.

\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}

Basic topology: topological spaces, compactness and connectedness, at the level of Sutherland's book. The course will not assume any knowledge of Algebraic Topology, but will go quite fast in order to reach more interesting material, so some previous exposure to simplicial homology or the fundamental group would be helpful. The Part III Differential Geometry course will also contain useful, relevant material.

Hatcher's book is especially recommended for the course, but there are many other suitable texts.
