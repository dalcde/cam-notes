Quantum Field Theory is the language in which modern particle physics is formulated. It represents the marriage of quantum mechanics with special relativity and provides the mathematical framework in which to describe the interactions of elementary particles.

This first Quantum Field Theory course introduces the basic types of fields which play an important role in high energy physics: scalar, spinor (Dirac), and vector (gauge) fields. The relativistic invariance and symmetry properties of these fields are discussed using Lagrangian language and Noether's theorem.

The quantisation of the basic non-interacting free fields is firstly developed using the Hamiltonian and canonical methods in terms of operators which create and annihilate particles and anti-particles. The associated Fock space of quantum physical states is explained together with ideas about how particles propagate in spacetime and their statistics. How these fields interact with a classical electromagnetic field is described.

Next, we introduce the path integral which is an alternative way of describing quantum fields. The path integral is fundamental in introducing interaction into quantum field theory. Interactions are described using perturbative theory and Feynman diagrams. This is first illustrated for theories with a purely scalar field interaction, and then for a couplings between scalar fields and fermions. Finally Quantum Electrodynamics, the theory of interacting photons, electrons and positrons, is introduced and elementary scattering processes are computed.

Finally, the idea of loops in Feynman diagrams are explored and the question of the consequent infinities looked at. Ways of dealing with the infinities will be explored in the Advanced Quantum Field Theory course which follows on directly from this one.

\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
You will need to be comfortable with the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical
mechanics and with special relativity. You will also need to have taken an advanced course on
quantum mechanics.
