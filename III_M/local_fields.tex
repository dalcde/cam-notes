The $p$-adic numbers $\Q_p$ (where $p$ is any prime) were invented by Hensel in the late 19th century, with a view to introduce function-theoretic methods into number theory. They are formed by completing $\Q$ with respect to the $p$-adic absolute value $|-|_p$ , defined for non-zero $x \in \Q$ by $|x|_p = p^{-n}$, where $x = p^n a/b$ with $a, b, n \in \Z$ and $a$ and $b$ are coprime to $p$. The $p$-adic absolute value allows one to study congruences modulo all powers of $p$ simultaneously, using analytic methods. The concept of a local field is an abstraction of the field $\Q_p$, and the theory involves an interesting blend of algebra and analysis. Local fields provide a natural tool to attack many number-theoretic problems, and they are ubiquitous in modern algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.

Topics likely to be covered include:
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
  \item The $p$-adic numbers. Local fields and their structure.
  \item Finite extensions, Galois theory and basic ramification theory.
  \item Polynomial equations; Hensel’s Lemma, Newton polygons.
  \item Continuous functions on the $p$-adic integers, Mahler’s Theorem.
  \item Local class field theory (time permitting).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
Basic algebra, including Galois theory, and basic concepts from point set topology and metric spaces. Some prior exposure to number fields might be useful, but is not essential.
